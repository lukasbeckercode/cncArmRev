#CNC-Arm
A CNC-Project to make a mechanical arm move

USE GRBL for Arduino. 

This program creates a web-server using port 8000 on the device you are running it on. <br />
The address should look something like this: 127.0.0.1:8000. <br />
On a raspberry pi, you should be able to access it via "raspberrypi:8000"
